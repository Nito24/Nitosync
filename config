#NITOSYNC DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE

#Declarate varible values in the standart sh way:
# --> VARIABLE=VALUE

#Posible variables:
#  remote | remote ip/address to connect to
#  sshport | default is 22
#  user | user to use to connect to the server
#  configpath | default is ~/.config/nitosync, nitosync will be able to read all files located in this directory for configuration
#  configfile | default is config
#  savepath | local savepath to sync to/from
#  remotepath | remote savepath to sync to/from
#  emulator | app/emulator/script... to execute between syncs
#  after |
#  after2 | 



#Simple sample configuration:

#  ITS VERY IMPORTANT TO SET PATHS CORRECTLY
#  ALL PATHS (FOLDERS) SHOULD END IN BACKSLASH /
#  '/my/path/'      This way files go correctly in path/
#          ^^^      Ex: /my/path/save1, /my/path/save2...

#emulator='/local/my/emulator/path/executable/'
#remote='my.web.net'
#user=myuser
#savepath='/local/my/emulator/path/saves/'
#remotepath='/remote/path/saves/'
